# Scale Late Joiner

A quick and dirty hack to sync scale changes of items for late joiners. When I say quick and dirty, I mean it. The initial version of this was written in about an hour in a rush, just to get something that works. It could now be changed to at least use dictionaries so it's not O(n) where n is the amount of items when doing basically anything with this system. It's a bad system in its current state.

# Contributing

This project uses [custom git filters](.gitattributes) to reduce the amount of noise generated by Udon and UdonSharp. These filters are not required in order to contribute, though without them all UdonSharp asset files will show as modified and those "changes" should not be committed.
